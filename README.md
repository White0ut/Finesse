Finesse
=======

Game Inventors Club's current video game in progress.  Uses Java with the Slick2d game library.


TO USE
=======

In order to use the Game you must have the slick libraries included in your build path. To do so in Eclipse follow these steps.<br/><br/>

1) Right click on the project and select 'Build Path' => 'Configure Build Path'<br/>
2) Tab to Libraries<br/>
3) For simplicity, remove all jars currently in Library besides the JRE Library<br/>
4) On the top click on Add Jar<br/>
5) Navigate through Finesse => slick => lib <br/>
6) Multi-select jinput.jar / lwjgl_util.jar / lwjgl.jar / slick.jar<br/>
7) Once returned to the Build Path page, drop down lwjgl_util and open up natives<br/>
8) Click workspace<br/>
9) Navigate through Finesse => slick => lwjgl-2.9.0 => native => your-current-os<br/>

Once finished you can run the slick game
