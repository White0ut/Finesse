Finesse
=======

Game Inventors Club's current video game in progress.  Uses Java with the Slick2d game library.


TO USE
=======

In order to use the Game you must have the slick libraries included in your build path. To do so in Eclipse follow these steps.

1) Right click on the project and select 'Build Path' => 'Configure Build Path'
2) Tab to Libraries
3) For simplicity, remove all jars currently in Library besides the JRE Library
4) On the top click on Add Jar
5) Navigate through Finesse => slick => lib 
6) Multi-select jinput.jar / lwjgl_util.jar / lwjgl.jar / slick.jar
7) Once returned to the Build Path page, drop down lwjgl_util and open up natives
8) Click workspace
9) Navigate through Finesse => slick => lwjgl-2.9.0 => native => your-current-os

Once finished you can run the slick game
